## SFTP Protocol

**In this project I used SFTP protocol to upload files from my local computer to my virtual ALX sandbox**

### Steps:

1. I used hostname, username, and password to access the sandbox environment
 
2. I used (cd) command to navigate to /root/alx-system_engineering-devops directory and created a new directory (command_line_for_the_win/) using (mkdir) command and Navigate to it
 
3. I used (lcd) command to navigate through my local computer to the directory where the files I want to upload are located

4. I used (put) command to upload files from my local computer to the sandbox environment
